<p>Fewer natural wildlife habitat areas remain each year. Moreover, the habitat that remains has often been degraded to bear little 
resemblance to the wild areas which existed in the past. Habitat loss due to destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat 
is the primary threat to the survival of wildlife.</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change: Global warming is making hot days hotter, rainfall and flooding heavier, hurricanes stronger and droughts more severe.
<li>Unregulated Hunting and poaching: Unregulated hunting and poaching causes a major threat to wildlife. Along with this, mismanagement 
of forest department and forest guards triggers this problem.
<li>Pollution: Pollutants released into the environment are ingested by a wide variety of organisms. Pesticides and toxic chemical being 
widely used, making the environment toxic to certain plants, insects, and rodents.
<li>Overexploitation: Overexploitation is the overuse of wildlife and plant species by people for food, clothing, pets, medicine, sport, 
and many other purposes.
<li>Deforestation: Humans are continually expanding and developing, leading to an invasion of wildlife habitats. As humans continue to grow, 
they clear forested land to create more space. This stresses wildlife populations as there are fewer homes and food sources for wildlife to survive.
<li>Population: The increasing population of human beings is a major threat to wildlife. More people on the globe means more consumption of food, 
water, and fuel, therefore more waste is generated. Major threats to wildlife are directly related to the increasing population of human beings.
