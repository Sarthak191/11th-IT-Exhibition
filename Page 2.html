<p>&nbsp;Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting animal species and their habitats. It is achieved partially through legislation such as the Endangered Species Act, the establishment and 
protection of public lands, and responsible public practices that conserve wild animal populations.</p>
<p>Wildlife plays an important role in balancing the ecosystem and provides stability to 
different natural processes of nature like rainfall(transpiration from plant),changing of temperature(heat evolution by animals),fertility of soil(making of manure by earthworm). The goal of 
wildlife conservation is to ensure that nature will be around for future generations to enjoy and also to recognize the importance of wildlife and wilderness for humans and other species alike.
Many nations have government agencies and NGO's dedicated to wildlife conservation, which help to implement policies designed to protect wildlife. Numerous independent non-profit organizations 
also promote various wildlife conservation causes.</p>
<p>Wildlife conservation has become an increasingly important practice due to the negative effects of human activity on wildlife. An endangered species is defined as a population of a living 
species that is in the danger of becoming extinct because the species has a very low or falling population, or because they are threatened by the varying environmental or prepositional parameters 
like (land slides,increasement in temperature above optimum temperature,acid rain) .Wildlife is part of nature which maintain equally distribution of food instead of over use of food by one humans.

<u><font size="6"><b>Major dangers to wildlife</b></font></u>
<p>Fewer natural wildlife habitat areas remain each year. Moreover, the habitat that remains has often been degraded to bear little resemblance to the wild areas which existed in the past.
 Habitat loss due to destruction, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat is the primary threat to the survival of wildlife.</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate change: Global warming is making hot days hotter, rainfall and flooding heavier, hurricanes stronger and droughts more severe. This intensification of weather and climate extremes 
will be the most visible impact of global warming in our everyday lives. It is also causing dangerous changes to the landscape of our world, adding stress to wildlife species and their habitat. 
Since many types of plants and animals have specific habitat requirements, climate change could cause a disastrous loss of wildlife species. A slight drop or rise in average rainfall will 
translate into large seasonal changes. Hibernating mammals, reptiles, amphibians and insects are harmed and disturbed. Plants and wildlife are sensitive to moisture change so, they will be harmed 
by any change in moisture level. Natural phenomena like floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, lightning and forest fires also affect wildlife.
<br><br>
<li>Unregulated Hunting and poaching: Unregulated hunting and poaching causes a major threat to wildlife. Along with this, mismanagement of forest department and forest guards triggers this problem.
